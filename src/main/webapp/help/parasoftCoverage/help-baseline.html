    Select the baseline to be used for the code coverage computation of this quality gate.

    The following different baselines are supported:

    <dl>
        <dt>Overall project - PROJECT</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the whole project. This is an absolute value that might not change much from build to build.
        </dd>
        <br/>
        <dt>Overall project (difference to reference job) - PROJECT_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the project coverages of the current build and the reference build. Teams can use this delta
            value to ensure that the coverage will not decrease.
        </dd>
        <br/>
        <dt>Modified code lines - MODIFIED_LINES</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the modified lines (e.g., within the modified lines of a pull or merge request)
            will focus on new or modified code only.
        </dd>
        <br/>
        <dt>Modified code lines (difference to modified files) - MODIFIED_LINES_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the modified files coverage and the modified lines coverage of the current build. Teams can use this delta
            value to compare between the modified lines coverage and the modified files coverage in pull requests.
        </dd>
    </dl>
