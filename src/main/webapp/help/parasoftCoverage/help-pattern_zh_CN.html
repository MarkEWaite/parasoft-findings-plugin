<div>
    A pattern is defined by an <a href="https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Ant Fileset ''includes''</a>
    setting that specifies the Parasoft coverage report files to read. Multiple patterns can be separated by space or comma.
    Note that such a pattern is resolved in Jenkins' workspace, so the paths must be relative only.
    If no pattern is specified then the default pattern "**/coverage.xml" will be used. (To be translated into zh_CN)
