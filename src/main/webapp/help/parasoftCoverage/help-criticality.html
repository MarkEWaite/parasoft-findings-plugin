<div>
    When a quality gate has been missed, this property determines whether the result of the associated coverage stage will
    be marked as unstable or failure.

    The following two options are possible:

    <dl>
        <dt>Unstable</dt>
        <dd>
            Set the build status to unstable if the quality gate has been missed.
        </dd>
        <br/>
        <dt>Failure</dt>
        <dd>
            Fail the step if the quality gate has been missed.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</div>
