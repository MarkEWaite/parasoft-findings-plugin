<div>
    Select the type to be used for the code coverage computation of this quality gate.

    The following different types are supported:

    <dl>
        <dt>Overall project</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the whole project. This is an absolute value that might not change much from build to build.
        </dd>
        <br/>
        <dt>Modified code lines</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the modified lines (e.g., within the modified lines of a pull or merge request)
            will focus on new or modified code only.
        </dd>
    </dl>
