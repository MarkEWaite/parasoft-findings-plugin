<div>
    You can override the default ID (i.e., URL) that is used to publish the coverage results in this job. This ID is used as
    link to the results, so choose a short and meaningful name.
    Allowed elements are characters, digits, dashes and underscores (more precisely,
    the ID must match the regular expression <code>\p{Alnum}[\p{Alnum}-_]*</code>). The chosen ID  must be
    unique in a job, i.e., it must not be already used by other results.
    If you leave the ID field empty, then the built-in default ID "coverage" will be used to show the results.
</div>
