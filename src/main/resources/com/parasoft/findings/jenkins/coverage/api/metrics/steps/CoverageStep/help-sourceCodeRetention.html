    Select the strategy that should be used to store the colored source code files.
    Storing the affected source code files along with the coverage information (which lines have been covered, which
    not) consumes a lot of space on your hard disk for large projects. So if your server has not enough free space
    available to store the sources for all builds it might make more sense to store only the coverage results of the
    last build. In this case, the plugin will automatically discard old results before the new sources will be stored.
    If you do not need the source files at all you can deactivate the storing of source code files.

    The following options are supported:

    <dl>
        <dt>NEVER</dt>
        <dd>Never store source code files.</dd>
        <dt>LAST_BUILD</dt>
        <dd>Store source code files of the last build, delete older artifacts.</dd>
        <dt>EVERY_BUILD</dt>
        <dd>Store source code files for all builds, never delete those files automatically.</dd>
    </dl>
</div>
