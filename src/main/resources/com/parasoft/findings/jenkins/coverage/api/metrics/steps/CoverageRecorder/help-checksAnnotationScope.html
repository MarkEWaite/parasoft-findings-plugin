    Select the scope of source code annotations in SCM checks.

    The following different scopes are supported:

    <dl>
        <dt>SKIP - Skip annotations</dt>
        <dd>
            Do not publish any annotations, just report the coverage report summary.
        </dd>
        <dt>MODIFIED_LINES - Publish annotations for modified lines</dt>
        <dd>
            Publish only annotations for lines that have been changed (with respect to the reference build).
            Teams can use these annotations to improve the quality of pull or merge requests.
        </dd>
        <dt>ALL_LINES - Publish annotations for all lines</dt>
        <dd>
            Publish annotations for existing and new code. There might be a lot of annotations depending on
            your code coverage.
        </dd>
    </dl>
