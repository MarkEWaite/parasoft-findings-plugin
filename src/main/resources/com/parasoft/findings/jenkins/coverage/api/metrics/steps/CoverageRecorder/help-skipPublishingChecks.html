    If this option is unchecked, then the plugin automatically publishes a summary of the coverage report to
    corresponding SCM hosting platforms. For example, if you are using this feature for a GitHub organization project,
    the coverage summary will be published to GitHub through the Checks API. If this operation slows down your build,
    or you don't want to publish the summary to SCM platforms, you can use this option to deactivate this feature.
